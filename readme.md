```

it is 2021 and I am doing Advent of Code again!

also periodically doing old problems for fun!

## Structure

solutions are in `/YEAR/day_X.lang`, mostly Ruby for now

all inputs are saved to `/YEAR/inputs/day_X.txt`

but I `.gitignore`d all the inputs for now, 'cause I'm not sure if it's poor form to commit this stuff idk

## Background

i worked retail for many holidays in a row, so this time period carries, for me, some *very specific* associations. I shant elaborate. But I'm doing this as a form of therapy, like maybe I can build new associations with Christmas! This is now the time of Mind Bicycles, or something! the positive feeling of accomplishment! a healthy collaborative and competitive spirit! fun little coding problems that are Christmas-themed!

in short: I want to love Christmas again
