```

it is 2021 and I am doing Advent of Code again!

also periodically doing old problems for fun!

## Structure

solutions are in `/YEAR/day_X.lang`, mostly Ruby, because Ruby is literally the only language designed to make programmers happy

and happiness is the goal here

all inputs are saved to `/YEAR/inputs/day_X.txt`

## Background

I worked retail for many holidays in a row, which kinda ruined Winter Holidays for me. So I'm doing this as a form of therapy, like maybe I can build new associations with Christmas! This is now the time of Mind Bicycles, or something! The positive feeling of accomplishment! A healthy collaborative and competitive spirit! Fun little coding problems that are Christmas-themed!

in short: I want to love Christmas again

Also, be kind to workers during the holidays. Their feet are hurting.
